Well i remember one of my close friends said that to one of my teachers during class and we all just burst into laughter and ate the brownies together as a class and those were some of the best brownies I had ever eaten. It inspired me to find the perfect brownie recipe that would give me the same feeling that those brownies did times 1000. Today I will be giving you guys a fudgy inside yet crunchy outside brownie recipe.</p><p>In order to make fudgy and chewy brownies you'll need the following ingrediebts:</p><p>-1 cup of unsalted butter.</p><p>-1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.</p><p>-1\2 tsp of Himalayan salt.</p><p>-1 tsp of baking powder.</p><p>-11\3 cups of all purpose flour.</p><p>-11\2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</p><p>-11/2 cups of brown sugar.</p><p>-1 cup of dark chocolate chunks (optional).</p><p>-3 large eggs(cold).</p><p>-Almonds (optional).</p><p>Instructions:</p><p>1.Preheat and prep: Preheat your oven to 175 . Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with partchment paper or grease it lightly with butter or non-stick spray.</p><p>2.Melt the butter: Add the buttter to a medium saucepan. Plate that over a low heat and cook the butter until it melts completely, then turn off the heat. make sure that your butter doesn't brown unless you would like a nutty caramel taste. Browning the buter can take away that pure chocolate flavour we want from our fudgy brownies.</p><p>3.In your saucepan stir in the sugar and cocoa: While your butter is still hot, stir in your brown sugar,vanilla extract,salt and cocoa powder.</p><p>4.Cool the mixture a little: Set your saucepan aside to give our mixture time to warm up a little for about 5 minutes. To test the temperature just touch the batter and it should be warm, not too hot that you need to pull away your finger.</p><p>5.Add the eggs: Add the chill eggs and make sure that you stir thoroughly after each egg to get that desired smooth brownie batter.</p><p>6.Beat in the flour: When our mixture looks thick,rich and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the mixture until it becomes very thick and when mixing it shouldn't be sticking to the sides.</p><p>7.Mix-ins: If using any extra ingredients, stir them into your batter. This is optional.</p><p>8.Bake the brownies: Now it is time for the part we have all been waiting for, the baking! Scrape the brownie batter into your well prepared pan and spread it evenly, make sure to push the batter into the corners of your pan. Bake the brownies for about 25-30 minutes, or until the edges are looking set and the middle is a little underbaked. A tip I have to help with checking the consistency of the brownies is by inserting a toothpick and seeing what has been left on the toothpick once taken out. in this case, we would want a somewhat moist batter left on the toothpick.</p><p>9.Once the brownies are done baking and you are happy with the consistency. We need to to let the brownies cool down completely in the pan to make sure that they have set properly. To cut them use a knife of your choice.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">10.Serve to your loved ones or eat them alone.
